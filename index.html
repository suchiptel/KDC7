<h1>Helpful to All</h1>
<p>In addition to grazing livestock, Shantilal also occasionally had to go to the farm. Motikakaâ€™s farm was located on the Itola side of the village and comprised of a field covering around 25 to 30 vigha of land. When the fields needed ploughing, Shantilal would also help by sitting on the plough. Whenever he went to graze cattle, Shantilal would take his textbooks with him. While the cattle were grazing, he would sit under the shade of a tree and read. </p>
